# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Text-to-Speech Converter in React(Intro)
This project is a text-to-speech converter implemented in React. It allows users to upload an image containing text, extract the text using Tesseract.js, and convert it to speech using the Speech Synthesis API. Users can also play and pause the speech, with the currently spoken word highlighted in real-time.

### clone the repository
git@gitlab.neubitat.com:experiments/1texttoospeech.git

### Install dependencies:
### `npm install tesseract.js`

### Usage
Upload an image containing text using the file input.
Select the language of the text (English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada).
Click the "Submit" button to extract the text and convert it to speech.
Use the "Play" and "Pause" buttons to control the speech playback.
The currently spoken word will be highlighted in the result section.

### Features
Extract text from images using Tesseract.js.
Convert text to speech using the Speech Synthesis API.
Highlight the currently spoken word in real-time.

### active word
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: black;
  font-weight: bold;
}
 This class is used to change the styling (such as color, background color, font weight, etc.) of the word to make it stand out while it is being read aloud.
